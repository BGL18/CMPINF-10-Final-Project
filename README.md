# CMPINF-10-Final-Project

## Pitt Band Bikers - Group 22

This is a project by Ryan O'Boyle (rto10@pitt.edu), Adam Funk (avf10@pitt.edu), and Brian Lindsay(bgl18@pitt.edu) that determines the best neighborhood in the City of Pittsburgh by inferring which neighborhood is the most suitable for bicycle riding. The submetrics that help determine this are data on air quality, bike traffic, and bike-related collisions.

The data sets used are:
* Air Quality: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-air-quality
* Traffic Count: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/traffic-count-data-city-of-pittsburgh
* Traffic Crash Report: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-crash-data

The trafficCountVisualization notebook was made by Adam Funk. The Crash Data notebook was made by Brian Lindsay. The Air Quality Notebook was made by Ryan O'Boyle.

This project involves the use of Jupyter notebooks and the Python programming language, as well as the "pandas" data analysis feature. It can be viewed on the Github repository file by file.
